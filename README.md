# Guestfs Docker Container

This image was created to use libguestfs tools on unraid. Rather than compiling libguestfs-tools for Slackware, a docker image with all the required tools is a simpler solution.

I created this image to more easily modify images in conjunction with my Ansible libvirt virtual machine management role.
